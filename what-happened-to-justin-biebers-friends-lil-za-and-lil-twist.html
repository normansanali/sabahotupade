The rapper, whose real name is Christopher Moore, was at one point signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money, and after forming ties with JB, it seemed as if a collaboration between the two was bound to happen sooner or later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead, the two were more occupied partying together as they traveled the world and jetted to endless destinations for tropical vacations before Twist was said to have moved into Bieber’s home in Calabasas, where he was also treated to JB’s luxury vehicles, including his pricey Ferrari.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Set To Release New Documentary Addressing Past Pain, Current Relationships, And New Music</a></span></p><p>In 2013, Twist took the vehicle for a spin when a photographer was struck by an oncoming vehicle and died trying to take a picture of who he thought was Bieber being pulled over by cops on a Los Angeles freeway.</p><p>When Twist moved down to Calabasas, Bieber was finding himself getting more and more noise complaints from neighbors, who stressed that the rowdiness throughout the day had become unbearable and that the “Sorry” hitmaker and his pals weren’t being cautious of other people in the neighborhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the end of 2014, when Bieber started recording Purpose, fans noticed that Twist was barely spending time with his former BFF, who many believed had been axed out by the singer’s team in an effort to make the Canadian native see that the life he was living was beginning to affect not just his own health but also the livelihood of those around him.</p><p>In June 2020, Twist claimed Bieber’s management team <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked him to take the heat</a> for the infamous drug charges that came with the house raid in 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Returns To SNL A Decade After First Appearance And Fans Are Proud Of His Journey</a></span></p><p>During an appearance on the Mina SayWhat podcast, he gushed: "His team had their knee, metaphorically, on my neck for years just so they could keep one side clean. I took that heat. If they would have put weed charges on Justin in his early career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It would have been bad on him. So I got a call one day saying, ‘Twist, do you really love this kid?’ I said, ‘Yes.’</p><p>“They said, ‘Cool, if you love him then you can take the heat for him because you can come off a little weed charge. You’re associated with Lil Wayne. You’re a rapper.’”</p><p>“It got to a point where I didn’t even have to be there at times and they were putting it, ‘Twist did it, Twist did it, Twist did it,’” he added.</p><p>And while Twist may no longer be in the picture, Bieber appears to have remained on good terms with Lil Za, who was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">infamously charged with three felonies</a> in relation to the raid at JB’s mansion.</p><p>Despite everything, Za - real name Xavier Smith - who has been close to the Biebs since 2012, still gets a lot of love from Bieber, who often comments on the socialite’s photos on Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber In POPSTAR & 9 Other Celebrity Cameos In Drake’s Music Videos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Za also attended Bieber and Baldwin’s wedding, showing clear signs that despite what’s happened in the past, the two have matured from their mistakes.</p><p>Over the summer of 2020, Za announced he’s expecting a baby with longtime sweetheart, Atifa Barwany, who held her baby shower back in September.</p><p>The couple is also looking to tie the knot, according to what Za had told one fan on Instagram, and when that day comes along, fans shouldn’t be surprised if Bieber makes an appearance.</p><p>After all, the pop star is still cool with Za while his friendship with Twist seems to have fizzled out as the years went by.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spot Ariana Grande’s New Man In Behind-The-Scenes Pics From Her ’34+35′ Video Shoot</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbUrKuipl2XtqauxKuqZp6inrKvsNJmo6KkXa%2Bubq3NnWSloZxiwbi10q1m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-justin-biebers-friends-lil-za-and-lil-twist.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Justin%20Biebers%20Friends%2c%20Lil%20Za%20And%20Lil%20Twist%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-justin-biebers-friends-lil-za-and-lil-twist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-justin-biebers-friends-lil-za-and-lil-twist.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Justin%20Biebers%20Friends%2c%20Lil%20Za%20And%20Lil%20Twist%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-justin-biebers-friends-lil-za-and-lil-twist.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Justin%20Biebers%20Friends%2c%20Lil%20Za%20And%20Lil%20Twist%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-justin-biebers-friends-lil-za-and-lil-twist.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Justin%20Biebers%20Friends%2c%20Lil%20Za%20And%20Lil%20Twist%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-justin-biebers-friends-lil-za-and-lil-twist.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Justin%20Biebers%20Friends%2c%20Lil%20Za%20And%20Lil%20Twist%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anna-mcgurn-bio-age-job-husband-pottery-throw-down.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Anna McGurn?
