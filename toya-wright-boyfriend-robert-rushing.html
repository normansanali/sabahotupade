Ever since she started dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Rushing</a> in 2017, she's been careful to keep the details of their romance private. But now that the happy couple share a child and are engaged, fans are curious to know a bit more about the husband-to-be. For instance, what does he do? And where did he grow up? Here's what you need to know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Robert Rushing originally from?</h2><p>Not much is known about his personal life, but Robert was born in Atlanta, Ga. The 33-year-old was a former athlete who played point guard for the Troy State Trojans while attending Troy University in Alabama. Perhaps his passion for the sport was what led him to pursue the career he has today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Robert "Red" Rushing do for a living?</h2><p>Robert is currently a sports manager for athletes and, according to reports, he has represented players like Tristan Thompson and Dwight Howard. In addition, he also owns a clothing line called "2 Commas." The brand was inspired by the American dream to become a millionaire, or in other words, to "make 2 Commas." His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> offers a variety of apparel, from hoodies and T-shirts to accessories and footwear.</p><p>In the past, Robert launched Rush Travel Group, a travel and lifestyle service that mainly catered to athletes, including LeBron James and Tristan Thompson. Robert shared quite a few promotional posts on his Instagram page, with the first one dating back to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012</a>. Their mission was to make traveling easier by managing all tasks after trips were booked, but as of now, it looks like this company is shut down.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In May of 2019, the former athlete announced the creation of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealth America Group</a>, which is meant to offer services like "credit repair, personal and business funding, personal business consulting, and more." However, the page hasn't been updated since July, so we can only assume that this project has been put on hold for now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He's partnering with Toya Wright for "Weight No More."</h2><p>It's safe to say that Robert wears many hats, because he's also been doing his part to help fight obesity, right alongside his fiancÃ©e. In 2019, the couple launched the health and fitness company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Weight No More</a> and it's a growing success. They've been hosting several fitness events in different states, as well as selling athletic wear and fitness products on their website.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He's related to a famous R&B singer.</h2><p>You might have heard of Faith Evans, also known as the First Lady of Bad Boy Records. The singer and actress is actually Robert's cousin, which means that talent definitely runs in the family. In one birthday tribute, he mentioned that he used to open up for her while she toured.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Robert and Toya get married?</h2><p>In November of 2019, Toya happily announced on her Instagram that she and her partner in crime were officially engaged. She shared a photo of the ring and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>: "Yes! Yes! And Yes! For humbling my spirit, for restoring my faith in love, for raising the bar, for being all of what a man should be. For each of these and more I SAY YES! Looking forward to forever with you."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before the engagement, the couple gave birth to their little girl, Reign, in 2018 (Toya is also the mom of 21-year-old Reginae Carter). But fans now want to know, did they secretly tie the knot? Considering how they keep their romance low key, it's understandable why fans would think this. However, neither Toya nor Robert have confirmed that they exchanged vows.</p><p>For now, it looks like we'll have to wait and see, but this will be Toya's third trip down the aisle. She was previously married to rapper Lil Wayne in 2004 to 2006, and to music producer Memphitz from 2011 to 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqby6rYywqaKfmKl6o7vYn6minZ6ZerO7wZ6prWWiqsCptc2g</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftoya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing.html&text=TV%20Star%20Toya%20Wright%27s%20Boyfriend%2c%20Robert%20Rushing%2c%20Is%20Now%20Her%20Fianc&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftoya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftoya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing.html&title=TV%20Star%20Toya%20Wright%27s%20Boyfriend%2c%20Robert%20Rushing%2c%20Is%20Now%20Her%20Fianc" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftoya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing.html&title=TV%20Star%20Toya%20Wright%27s%20Boyfriend%2c%20Robert%20Rushing%2c%20Is%20Now%20Her%20Fianc" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftoya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing.html&title=TV%20Star%20Toya%20Wright%27s%20Boyfriend%2c%20Robert%20Rushing%2c%20Is%20Now%20Her%20Fianc" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftoya-wright-boyfriend-robert-rushing.html&description=TV%20Star%20Toya%20Wright%27s%20Boyfriend%2c%20Robert%20Rushing%2c%20Is%20Now%20Her%20Fianc" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./was-tj-finley-arrested-on-attempt-to-elude-charges.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was TJ Finley Arrested On Attempt To Elude Charges: What Did He Do Exactly?
