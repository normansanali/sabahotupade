The Seinfeld co-creator and comedic genius is something of a legend. A man who is so unequivocally and unapologetically himself it makes fans look past all the things that would turn them off of other people. In fact, it's Larry's foible that makes him who he is. So many of these personality traits have been informed by real-life experiences which have<a href=#> found their way into his comedy</a>. Even Larry's brief (yet confrontational)<a href=#> time on Saturday Night Live made its way into an episode of Seinfeld</a>. And, in some way or another, Larry's opinions about former <a href=#>President Donald Trump</a> have found their way onto Curb Your Enthusiasm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But fans of all political stripes like Larry because Curb mostly stays away from making any sort of political statement. However, those who know Larry personal are aware that he is very opinionated about politics. So much so that he even stopped being friends with a very successful individual who backed up Trump during his impeachment hearings. Not only that, but<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Larry actually got into a verbal altercation with him</a> in public. Here's what happened...</p><h2 id=alan-dershowitz-has-always-been-a-controversial-figure-who-is-dedicated-to-the-constitution>Alan Dershowitz Has Always Been A Controversial Figure Who is Dedicated To The Constitution</h2><p>For many, lawyer and massively successful author, Alan Dershowitz is a hero. The traditionally Democratic Party voter has been involved in a number of landmark cases as well as had stood up for a number of human rights causes, including his avid fight against antisemitism. But for all of Mr. Dershowitz's accomplishments, he has been accused of some pretty heinous things. Most notably, being involved with Jeffrey Epstein's sex traffic ring. Of course, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that this massive accusation is accurate and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Dershowitz has sued Netflix</a> over running with the story in their documentary on the case. So, before you rush to judgment on this one, keep pressing for all the facts because they're not all in yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Megan Mullally Regrets This Incident Between Her And Donald Trump</a></span></p><p>However, people have been displeased with Alan Dershowitz due to his involvement in some of the most controversial court cases of all time. This includes that of OJ Simpson, Julian Assange, Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Brett Kavanaugh, and, of course, Donald Trump. In each of these cases, Mr. Dershowitz was on the defense team or counsel for the defense for these accused individuals. Of course, as Mr. Dershowitz correctly and constantly exclaims, it is every American's right to a lawyer, even if that lawyer disagrees with them. It's innocent until proven guilty despite what the court of public opinion or the Twitter world claim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is the defense that Alan Dershowitz has used when people attack him over siding with Donald Trump in the impeachment hearings against him. But unlike some of these other cases, Mr. Dershowitz firmly believed that the impeachment accusations against former President Trump weren't constitutionally solid. Despite supporting both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Joe Biden in the 2016 and 2020 elections respectively, Alan Dersjowitz stood by Donald Trump in this case. And his liberal friends, including Larry David, punished him for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern Ended His Friendship With Donald Trump For This Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-and-how-larry-got-into-a-fight-with-alan-dershowitz>Why And How Larry Got Into A Fight With Alan Dershowitz</h2><p>Following the impeachment hearing in 2018, Alan Dershowitz found himself on the outs with many of his liberal friends and neighbors on Martha's Vineyard, where he has a home. Many of the rich and famous liberals on the beautiful island had been friends with Alan for years. After all, Alan has been constantly a Democrat and left-of-center on many issues. But his support of Donald Trump got him shunned. And this shunning and stuck years alter as just this past summer he got into an altercation with Larry David (another Martha's Vineyard owner) at a grocery store where both have been spotted numerous times.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Page Six</a>, Mr. Dershowitz approached Larry at the grocery store and asked if the two of them could talk.</p><p>"No. No. We really can’t. I saw you. I saw you with your arm around [former Trump Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo! It’s disgusting!" Larry allegedly responded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He’s my former student [at Harvard Law]. I greet all of my former students that way. I can’t greet my former students?" Alan allegedly responded.</p><p>"It’s disgusting. Your whole enclave — it’s disgusting. You’re disgusting!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Timothee Chalamet And Larry David Formed An Unlikely Friendship</a></span></p><p>As Larry walked away, witnesses claim that Mr. Dershowitz displayed his undershirt which had "It's the condition stupid" written across it. Again, this has been the acclaimed lawyer's response to much of his legal history. But that doesn't mean it hasn't angered many people, including Larry David.</p><p>Whether Larry did the right thing or not is debatable, especially given how divided the U.S. has become. But perhaps Larry has other reasons for doing what he did. But Alan Dershowitz, Larry has not publicly commented on his exchange on Martha's Vineyard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Larry David Is Actually Like, According to Fans Who've Met Him</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmqqirnqlrdWim2afn6l6qrrTqGSapl2WubWx0ZyYraGfo3q4tdOhZKGho2KzornOrqpmnqKesq%2BwjK2sq6aVmXq1vtSmp2arpaW9sL7TnqlmmZyWu26wxKuqoaennsG7ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flarry-david-got-into-an-altercation-with-his-famous-friend-turned-trump-supporter-alan-dershowitz.html&text=Larry%20David%20Got%20Into%20An%20Altercation%20With%20His%20Famous%20Friend%20Turned%20Trump%20Supporter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flarry-david-got-into-an-altercation-with-his-famous-friend-turned-trump-supporter-alan-dershowitz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flarry-david-got-into-an-altercation-with-his-famous-friend-turned-trump-supporter-alan-dershowitz.html&title=Larry%20David%20Got%20Into%20An%20Altercation%20With%20His%20Famous%20Friend%20Turned%20Trump%20Supporter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flarry-david-got-into-an-altercation-with-his-famous-friend-turned-trump-supporter-alan-dershowitz.html&title=Larry%20David%20Got%20Into%20An%20Altercation%20With%20His%20Famous%20Friend%20Turned%20Trump%20Supporter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flarry-david-got-into-an-altercation-with-his-famous-friend-turned-trump-supporter-alan-dershowitz.html&title=Larry%20David%20Got%20Into%20An%20Altercation%20With%20His%20Famous%20Friend%20Turned%20Trump%20Supporter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flarry-david-got-into-an-altercation-with-his-famous-friend-turned-trump-supporter-alan-dershowitz.html&description=Larry%20David%20Got%20Into%20An%20Altercation%20With%20His%20Famous%20Friend%20Turned%20Trump%20Supporter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meet-rosie-odonnells-daughter-vivienne-rose-odonnell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Rosie ODonnells daughter Vivienne Rose ODonnell?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kendall-jenner-levis-501-jeans-amazon-8357900.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kendall Jenner Wore the Booty-Lifting Jeans Ive Owned for 7 Years">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
