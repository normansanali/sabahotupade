However, due to its ever-shifting catalog and the sometimes chaotic nature of anime distribution and licensing, it can often be hard to know what’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Crunchyroll</a>, especially if you’re looking for something specific.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>But don’t worry. If you’re craving something chilling, here are the thirteen best horror anime you can currently watch on Crunchyroll.</p><h2 id=h-13-tokyo-ghoul data-injectable=false>13. Tokyo Ghoul</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>For those who like their seinen with a bit of horror, you could do much worse than the supernatural series&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo Ghoul</a>. It follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who narrowly survives a deadly encounter with his date, Rize Kamishiro, who turns out to be a man-eating ghoul.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>After being taken to the hospital in critical condition., Kaneki discovers he underwent surgery that changed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because Rize’s organs were transferred into his body, so he must consume human flesh to survive, just as ghouls do. In his new life as a half-ghoul, he is taken in by the ghouls who run the coffee shop Anteiku. It is difficult for him to fit into the ghoul society, as well as keep his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from Hideyoshi Nagachika, his best friend.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>With Kaneki’s journey as the protagonist, this series thrives because of the main character’s development and psychological profile. The contrast between light and darkness is the element that shines brightest in this series. This anime can be dark and moody, so the little moments of lightheartedness are genuinely endearing. They make you recognize how precious levity truly is, giving one more reason among many to start watching&nbsp;Tokyo Ghoul.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-12-hellsing-ultimate data-injectable=false>12. Hellsing Ultimate</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=857 data-injectable=true>An original video animation (OVA) released from Feb. 10, 2006, to Dec. 26, 2012, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellsing Ultimate</a>&nbsp;series is a darkly imaginative, thought-provoking anime based on the manga Hellsing. Located in Great Britain, the Hellsing Organization is a clandestine organization that is dedicated to preventing supernatural threats from occurring. It begins with one such vampire ravaging an English village and turning its inhabitants into “ghouls.” As a result, Hellsing sends its most powerful operative, Alucard, to deal with the situation.</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>To kill the vampire, Alucard shoots through Seras Victoria, the last survivor of the police force sent to handle the situation to save her. As Seras bleeds out, Alucard makes a deal with her: He can save her life…but only if she agrees to become a vampire herself. Seras agrees, and Alucard turns her. She becomes the newest Hellsing member shortly thereafter. As Seras adjusts to life as a vampire in Hellsing’s employ, she unravels the mystery of the artificial vampires and the mass-produced undead known as FREAKs.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Hellsing Ultimate&nbsp;is home to one of the strongest vampires in any genre, Alucard, and his abilities are vividly illustrated. The protagonists are varied and distinct, while the voice actors have been carefully chosen to give the characters a sense of life. Character development is also quite strong, while the violence and action are a sight to behold. Vampire enthusiasts should definitely give this one a try.</p><h2 id=h-11-mieruko-chan data-injectable=false>11.

Unlike some of these other entries, Made in Abyss is primarily a fantasy-adventure series that, all of a sudden, sucker punches you with the most gut-wrenching horror when you’ve already grown comfortable and complacent in the story. Around Episode 10 of Season 1, if you’re not devoid of feeling, Made in Abyss will pull and twist at your heartstrings. As a Redditor put it:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/SuperiorCardboardBox</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>anime</a></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>“Watch at your own risk”, is a just warning to give anyone brave to go into the depths of the Abyss with our two protagonists. The series’ soundtrack is also something out of this world, which befits one of the most spectacular settings to be seen in an anime. Although it might not be for the faint of heart, Made in Abyss is a journey worth witnessing with one’s own eyes and with as few prior spoilers as possible.</p><h2 id=h-2-kowabon data-injectable=false>2. Kowabon</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Made in 2015,&nbsp;Kowabon&nbsp;is a fascinating miniseries with a unique visual style. The series contains 13 three-minute episodes, each telling a different story about a ghost tormenting someone. Each of these stories is shown via an in-universe camera, from webcams to security cameras, giving a fascinating, almost voyeuristic found-footage feeling to the show.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>However, what stands out the most is&nbsp;Kowabon’s&nbsp;rotoscoped animation. This gives everything a strange vibe, recognizable while also being otherwordly, which only helps to intensify the scares, meaning each short will leave you shaken despite its short length.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-1-theatre-of-darkness-yamishibai data-injectable=false>1. Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Starting in 2013,&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;has been running for over 118 episodes. Each episode of&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;is only four minutes long, and each tells a different ghost story, many of which are based on Japanese myths and legends. This means that the show has a lot of variety with scares of all kinds, from ghosts to monsters.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=860 data-injectable=true>What makes&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;stand out is its visual style. It is designed to emulate the look of Kamishibai, a form of performance that became popular in the 1930s. Usually performed on street corners, Kamishibai features a narrator telling a story using a series of hand-painted wooden boards as illustrations. The animators of&nbsp;Yamishibai&nbsp;did a fantastic job of emulating this visual style, which helped it create many memorable scenes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=false>In addition, the writing is superb, with the stories able to leave a lasting impact despite only running for a few minutes each time. In fact, the concise nature of the stories is often to their advantage, leaving the hauntings mostly unexplained, adding to the fear factor. So if you’re looking for quick scares,&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;is precisely what you need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY5qamaalajBbrTOq6moql2Wu6q5xGamp2WTp8Kvr8eyqaiknGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f13-best-horror-anime-on-crunchyroll.html&text=13%20best%20horror%20anime%20on%20Crunchyroll&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f13-best-horror-anime-on-crunchyroll.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f13-best-horror-anime-on-crunchyroll.html&title=13%20best%20horror%20anime%20on%20Crunchyroll" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f13-best-horror-anime-on-crunchyroll.html&title=13%20best%20horror%20anime%20on%20Crunchyroll" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f13-best-horror-anime-on-crunchyroll.html&title=13%20best%20horror%20anime%20on%20Crunchyroll" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f13-best-horror-anime-on-crunchyroll.html&description=13%20best%20horror%20anime%20on%20Crunchyroll" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-raised-mormon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrities You Didnt Know Were Raised Mormon">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hitler-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Hitler Movies With Wildly Diverse Depictions Of The Fhrer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
