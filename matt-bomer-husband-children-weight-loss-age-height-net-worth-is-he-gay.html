His father was a Dallas Cowboys draft pick who played for the team from 1972-1974.</span><span>Bomer has a sister named Megan Bomer and a brother named Neill Bomer who is an engineer.&nbsp;He is also a distant cousin of music artist Justin Timberlake.</span></p><p><span>Bomer grew up in Texas in the spring and attended junior high school, and by the age of 17 he was performing on stage organized by the Alley Theater in downtown Houston.&nbsp;After graduating from high school, he decided to study art at Carnegie Mellon University, where he graduated in 2001.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career & Wealth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Mat Bomer, who had just graduated from university, moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting.&nbsp;While in town, he worked in theater and landed his first role on television, followed by soap operas and the film series.&nbsp;</span><span>Mystery Fantasy</span><span>&nbsp;(2002).</span></p><span>From 2002 to 2003, Bomer appeared in six episodes of the soap opera&nbsp;</span><span>Exemplary</span><span>&nbsp;;&nbsp;where he played the role of a serial killer withmale prostitutes.&nbsp;For his performance on the series, Bomer won a Gold Derby Award for Younger Actor.&nbsp;With the magnitude of his success, he landed a role in the Supernatural drama&nbsp;</span><span>series Tru Calling</span><span>&nbsp;(2003 – 2004).</span><p><span>Matt Bomer made his film debut as a flight attendant in the German-American thriller&nbsp;</span><span>Flugplan.&nbsp;</span><span>The film became his highest-grossing film to date, grossing $223.3 million worldwide.&nbsp;This was followed by&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2006), in which Bomer played the role of Vietnam War veteran Eric who was captured by serial killers.&nbsp;His other films and television credits include&nbsp;</span><i><span>Amy Coyne</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2006);&nbsp;His first leading role&nbsp;</span><i><span>Traveler</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2007);&nbsp;</span><i><span>Lining</span></i><span>&nbsp;(2007–2009);&nbsp;</span><i><span>white collar</span></i><span>(2009), which gave a positive review of his performance;&nbsp;and later won a People’s Choice Award at the 2015 ceremony.
