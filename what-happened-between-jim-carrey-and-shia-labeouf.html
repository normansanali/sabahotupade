This includes Shia LaBeouf, who took a jab of his own.</p><p>Let's see what happened between these two actors!</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-is-a-comedy-legend-who-39-s-had-an-outstanding-career>Jim Carrey Is A Comedy Legend Who's Had An Outstanding Career</h2><p>During the 1990s, Jim Carrey went from sketch comedy funny guy to blockbuster movie star after making a string of brilliant decisions with his career. The potential was always there, and once he got his chance to shine, Carrey took off and never looked back.</p><p>That fateful decade saw the star leading one film after the next to box office glory. Hits like Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, and more all helped him become one of Hollywood's biggest stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was Carrey helping movies make a fortune, but he was pocketing millions, as well.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, "Jim Carrey was the first actor in history to earn $20 million for a single film, a feat he accomplished with 1996's "The Cable Guy". During his career to date he has earned hundreds of millions of dollars from film salaries and backend bonuses."</p><p>Carrey has spent years in Hollywood, and he has not always had the kindest things to say about others, even if he's just poking fun. This was especially true some time back when he took a jab at Shia LaBeouf.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>It Took Bill Maher 25 Years To Get Jim Carrey On Real Time But It Was Worth The Wait</a></span></p><h2 id=he-took-some-shots-at-shia-labeouf-a-few-years-back>He Took Some Shots At Shia LaBeouf A Few Years Back</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Swift</a>, "One of Jim Carrey's strangest feuds involves actor Shia LaBeouf. This one reportedly started when Carrey poked fun at LaBeouf during the 2014 Golden Globes. Carrey's joke addressed the allegation that LaBeouf plagiarized the work of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes, and then apologized for the incident with a response supposedly lifted from Yahoo! Answers.</p><p>After reciting the famous saying, "Dying is easy. Comedy is hard," Carrey quipped: "I believe it was Shia LaBeouf who said that. So young, so wise.'"</p><p>Forgot all about that plagiarism incident, didn't you?</p><p>This was a truly strange time for LaBeouf, as he was called out by virtually everyone for his plagiarism. Carrey really took things to another by doing it in such a public manner, and many people found the jab to be quite humorous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One person who didn't find it funny? Shia himself, who eventually took a shot of his own.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jim Carrey Went From Making $0 In Yes Man To $50 Million When The Film Got Released</a></span></p><h2 id=shia-hit-back-immediately>Shia Hit Back Immediately</h2><p>So, how did Shia get back at Jim Carrey for making fun of him? Well, the former Disney Channel star took to Twitter to call out Carrey for his parenting skills.</p><p>"The former Disney star posted a YouTube video of Carrey's daughter's band, "The Jane Carrey Band," and then tweeted, "At least I don't get arrested for indecency on major LA highways! Or abandon love child's [sic],'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Huffington Post</a> reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's a pretty low blow for LaBeouf, who was clearly furious with Carrey for making fun of him.</p><p>For the uninformed, Jane Carrey is Jim's daughter, and she's done music and acting in her lifetime.</p><p>Jenny McCarthy, who previously dated Carrey and got to know his daughter well, spoke up in defense of both.</p><p>"Jim and I have become friends now since our breakup. We dated for five years and I got to know his daughter, Jane, who is a lovely, lovely girl. It's completely uncalled for and wrong. Jim is a great father. He loves Jane more than anything in the world. Shia did apologize and Jim did take it, but the whole thing is, do not bring our children into it," she said.</p><p>Eventually, Shia retracted his statement.</p><p>"Jim Carrey states that he is deeply involved in his daughter's life â€“ I accept that,regret tweet on the matter. Apologies to both parents," he posted in an apology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Ariana Grande And Jim Carrey's Insane Dating Rumor Based In Any Ounce Of Truth?</a></span></p><p>This was a strange celebrity feud that no one saw coming at the time, and thankfully, enough time has passed for most people to have completely forgotten about it entirely. No word on where they stand today, but hopefully, they would be cordial with one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmopmieqSt0aucsmWRo7Fuv8eimGakkZeysMHFaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jim-carrey-and-shia-labeouf.html&text=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jim%20Carrey%20And%20Shia%20LaBeouf%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-jim-carrey-and-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jim-carrey-and-shia-labeouf.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jim%20Carrey%20And%20Shia%20LaBeouf%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jim-carrey-and-shia-labeouf.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jim%20Carrey%20And%20Shia%20LaBeouf%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jim-carrey-and-shia-labeouf.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jim%20Carrey%20And%20Shia%20LaBeouf%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-jim-carrey-and-shia-labeouf.html&description=What%20Happened%20Between%20Jim%20Carrey%20And%20Shia%20LaBeouf%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-most-people-dont-know-about-andy-samberg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Most People Don't Know About Andy Samberg">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./transformer-prime-gets-403-ics-update.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Transformer Prime Gets 4.0.3 (ICS) Update">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
