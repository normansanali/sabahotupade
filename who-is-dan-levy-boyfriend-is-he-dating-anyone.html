Unfortunately, throughout Dan’s career, we hardly hear any news about the person that he’s dating or his thoughts about relationships in his life.</p><p>That information is incredibly hard to get, remembering how private he is. Dan’s fame isn’t something that is just “usual,” especially after he was featured as Sexiest Man Alive in 2020 by PEOPLE Magazine. His professional life is enough to make us adore him and realize how talented he is, let alone his handsome and sexy looks.</p><p>Dan Levy is currently single, he’s been single for quite a long time.

People still love him for the way he is, and his career is ever-increasing. Because, why would anyone not like him, right? It would be a silly thing to do.</p><p>Dan came out to his dad and mother while they were all enjoying lunch together.
