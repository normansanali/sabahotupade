Schneps has done a good job of keeping her personal information out of the public eye, and she still hasn’t said how old she is.</p><p>When the new episodes come out, fans hope to learn more about Oriana. But based on her pictures, she looks like she is in her mid-twenties to early-thirties.</p><p>Schneps went to college from 2012 to 2016 and graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, according to her LinkedIn profile. Taking into account the dates, the actress should be in her late 20s at the moment.</p><p>Since the average American college student starts at 18 after graduating from high school, she should be in her 20s right now.</p><p>Oriana seems young, full of life, and full of promise.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Chrisean Rock Net Worth: How Rich Is She?

She learned to fence, ride a horse, and scuba dive when she was young. She also spent her 20s traveling the world with her family on vacations.</p><p>Even though she hasn’t told anyone who her parents are or what they look like, she did grow up in a loving home.

Oriana recently went to the West Coast to see John and his restaurant, Fool’s Errand.

It will be the first time for nine cast and crew members to be in front of the camera.</p><p>Oriana Schneps is one of the crew members. She will be on Captain Kerry Titheradge’s yacht, Mercury. Even though her Bravo profile said she had worked as a chief stew before, Oriana will join Below Deck Adventure as a stew on the interior team.</p><p>“Oriana is ready to prove herself on the interior team. She is a hard worker who has worked as a chief stew before. But when she gets caught up in a fight in her department, she has to show that she can rise above it and get the job done. Oriana Schneps is an entrepreneur, a yacht broker, and a lot more.</p><p>Since she began working at a Boston aquarium, Oriana Schneps has been drawn to water. According to her Bravo profile, she found her calling in college when she took part in a scuba diving research trip to the Bahamas. So, right after she finished college at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, she started sailing.</p><p>Her LinkedIn page says that Oriana has a lot of experience. In the beginning of her career, she worked at International Yachting as a chief stew for about two years. There, she “managed worldwide operations of yachts up to 200 feet.”</p><p>In 2018, Oriana got a job as an Estate Operations Manager at a family estate with several properties. She only worked there for five months (June–October). On her LinkedIn page, it said that she also started an online store called Doon Designs in 2019 while working full-time as an Account Executive at VaynerMedia. In the same year, she changed jobs and became an account executive at The Sasha Group, where she worked until March 2020.</p><p>During the pandemic, she changed jobs again and got a job at String and Key as a Senior Strategic Analyst. She quit her job in August 2021 and joined the crew of Bravo’s Below Deck Adventure.</p><p>This year, the business owner helped start a new blockchain company called Lazy 8ight Yacht Club and started working at United Yacht Sales as a yacht broker. Oriana also started the digital media group Disco House NYC in May 2018 and ran it until July 2020.</p><p>Oriana has a very impressive resume, and she also has an interesting Instagram feed where she posts photos of all her adventures, including a few with the person she’s dating. John Dampeer is her love interest, and he owns a bar called Fool’s Errand.</p><p>In the meantime, Oriana is going to be on the show Below Deck Adventure on Bravo.</p><p>Oriana Schneps will be on Captain Kerry Titheradge’s crew as a member of the interior team. She will work as a stew and have the same job title as Kasie Faddah. Both of them will work under the direction of Faye Clarke, who is the chief stew.</p><p>In season 1 of Below Deck Adventure, you’ll also see chef Jessica Condy, bosun Lewin Lupton, and deckhands Nathan Morely, Michael Gilman, and Kyle Dickard.</p><p>The new show will be the fourth spin-off of the franchise. Below Deck is the name of the first one, and Below Deck Mediterranean, Below Deck Sailing Yacht, and Below Deck Down Under are its spin-offs. There are different captains and crews on each of these shows.</p><p>On the first episode of Below Deck Adventure, which will air on November 1, nine Mercury crew members will set sail and take care of all the guests’ needs.</p><p>The motor yacht’s first season is spent cruising around the cold waters (and fjords!) of Norway. Captain Kerry Titheradge is in charge.</p><p>Even though the captain is new to the Below Deck world, he has been in the yachting business for a long time. Find out more about his work history, his personal life, and how he is related to the other captains on Below Deck below.</p><h2>His work life</h2><p>The Australian has been working on boats for about 30 years, and yachts in particular for about 20 years. Kerry has been on cruises in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Captain Kerry is also the owner and chief executive officer of a boat service called Yachting Concepts.</p><h2>His life at home</h2><p>Captain Kerry is a parent, just like Captain Lee Rosbach and Captain Jason Chambers. He has a daughter and a son.</p><p>Captain Kerry lives with his kids in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, when he’s not on a boat.</p><p>The person in charge of the Below Deck Adventure is seeing a “lovely lady.”</p><h2>He got along well with Captain Lee.</h2><p>Most of the time, the five captains on the different shows in the Below Deck franchise get to know each other. However, Captain Kerry knew Captain Lee long before he joined the cast of Below Deck Adventure.</p><p>Below Deck, Captain Lee Rosbach Talks About the One Person He Regrets Firing</p><p>Captain Kerry told people at BravoCon 2022 that he met the Stud of the Sea for the first time about ten years ago at a golf tournament.</p><p>When Captain Kerry was asked to be on Below Deck Adventure, he called Captain Lee to ask if he had any regrets about being on the show.</p><p>“When the chance to do this came up, I called Lee and asked if he would do it again if he had to do it over?” In the video above, Kerry talks about it. “ He said, “That’s for sure.”</p><p>Captain Kerry also met Captain Jason, Captain Glenn Shephard, and Captain Sandy Yawn when they all showed up for the BravoCon weekend. He showed off a picture of himself and Jason taken before the event began.</p><p>In the caption, he wrote, “Night before BravoCon, having a few beers with Captain Jason from [Below Deck Down Under] and meeting some great Bravo fans.”</p><h2>He was on Below Deck Adventure for a while</h2><p>Captain Kerry gave a big hint about the first season of Below Deck Adventure before it started.</p><p>“A lot of trouble is going on. There are some people I wish I had let go. In the video, he says, “No regrets.” “The hot tub is also a lively place.”</p><p>People will have to watch the first episode of the new season to find out what happens to the Mercury crew.</p><p>Below Deck Adventure starts on November 1 and airs on Peacock on Wednesdays at 9/8c and Tuesdays at 9/8c.
