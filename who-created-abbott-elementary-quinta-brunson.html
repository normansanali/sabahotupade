The show is based on Quinta Brunson's middle school teacher Ms. Abbott, who Quinta recalls stayed close to her long after she left middle school. Abbott Elementary boasts an amazing cast as part of its production, including the likes of Quinta Brunson herself as the lead protagonist on the show. And this is certainly not Brunson's first acting gig, having made appearances in the likes of New Girl and iZombie, while also doing some voice acting for popular shows like Lazor Wulf and Big Mouth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brunson, like many before her, had to work her way up the Hollywood food chain before she was able to become the lead in a show, and her beginnings in the industry are definitely humble. While many may get their start as a background actor, Brunson got her foot in the door thanks largely in part to her social media presence.</p><h2 id=her-popularity-started-on-social-media>Her Popularity Started On Social Media</h2><p>Quinta Brunson's career path started, oddly enough, on social media platforms, more specifically Instagram and her own YouTube Channel. The then-unknown comedian used to post short sketches that she would star in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is 'Abbott Elementary' Worth Watching? What The Reviews Are Saying">Is 'Abbott Elementary' Worth Watching? What The Reviews Are Saying</a></span></p><p>Slowly but surely, Brunson's social media presence started to gain traction and her following blew up. People flocked to her social media pages to see what kind of content she posted for their entertainment, even sharing her posts several times, allowing Brunson to eventually go viral.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And as she went viral, popular portions of her video posts became incredibly popular memes. Many fans of Brunson may know her specifically from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He Got Money meme</a>, a reference to a now-deleted Instagram post that the comedian made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar51673283.jpg><p>The clip was originally uploaded in 2014 under the name The Girl Who's Never Been on a Nice Date, which shows Brunson acting surprised at the number of snacks her date in the clip is ordering, which makes her exclaim "He got money!"</p><p>The post is still available on Quinta's YouTube page and boasts an impressive 1.4 million views with 17,000 likes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was once again brought to the forefront of social media when a viewer of Abbott Elementary noticed a slight nod to the viral post in an episode of the show.</p><h2 id=many-may-recognize-brunson-from-her-buzzfeed-days>Many May Recognize Brunson From Her BuzzFeed Days</h2><p>While Brunson definitely went viral in the early days of her online career, many fans and viewers of her content will likely recognize her from her time at BuzzFeed, one of the largest media companies in the country, which pumps out anything from news to cooking tutorials.</p><p>Quinta Brunson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was part of the BuzzFeed family</a> from 2014 through 2017 and made a total of 43 posts according to her author page. Joining BuzzFeed was a logical step for Quinta, <a href=#>who had been showing an interest in comedy since high school</a>, as it really allowed her to flex her creative muscles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Everything Shane Madej And Ryan Bergara Did After Leaving Buzzfeed">Everything Shane Madej And Ryan Bergara Did After Leaving Buzzfeed</a></span></p><p>She has appeared in videos alongside Keith Habersberger of Try Guys fame, and has made a wide variety of sketches for the platform including comedic ones like Conversations All Cat People Will Recognize, and ones that address more serious topics like Social Media. Vs. Real Life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quinta eventually left the BuzzFeed platform, something she addressed with BuzzFeed directly a few years after she had moved on in her career.</p><p>She admits "For me, it was time to leave when my ambitions kind of became different than just working a nine to five. Requesting time off, to do things like write on a TV show and that conflicted with keeping a nine to five honestly."</p><p>She goes on to admit that she looked at the experience like going her college and that it was finally her time to graduate.</p><p>Brunson further clarifies that she didn't leave because of any negative experiences, because there simply weren't any that made her want to leave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brunson says "I feel fortunate to have had the experience" and that it was a very positive experience overall which allowed her to support herself, others, and other young Black creators.</p><h2 id=she-is-the-creative-visionary-for-abbott-elementary>She Is The Creative Visionary For Abbott Elementary</h2><p>Abbott Elementary boasts an amazing cast including the likes of Sheryl Lee Ralph, Lisa Ann Walter, Tyler James WIlliams, and, of course, Quinta Brunson as the lead role on the show.</p><p><a href=#>The show has been compared to the likes of The Office</a>, perhaps the most popular mockumentary-style show out there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is The Office Offensive?
