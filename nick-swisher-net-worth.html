Nick is a professional baseball player, having played for several teams in Major League Baseball(MLB) including the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and New York Yankees. He helped the Yankees win the 2009 World Series, and all of his efforts helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Nick Swisher? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $40 million, mostly earned through his career in professional baseball. It was reported that he has earned around $10.5 million annually thanks to the high valued contracts he has signed. As his career continues, it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Nick Swisher Net Worth $40 million</h3><p>Nick is the son of former major leaguer Steve Swisher. He attended Parkersburg High School and excelled in both football and baseball. He was recruited by high profile football programs but decided to be a part of the Major League Baseball Draft. After he went undrafted, he attended Ohio State University and played for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He became a Big Ten Freshman of the year, and would earn a reputation for his skills as first baseman and outfielder.</p><p>In 2002, he was drafted by the Oakland Athletics as one of the picks based off a new system implemented by <a href=#>Billy Beane</a>, a move further discussed in the book and film “Moneyball”. Swisher became part of the Class-A Vancouver Canadians and was then promoted to the Visalia Oaks. The following year, he was a part of the Modesto A’s and played 51 games before he was promoted to the AA Midland Rockhounds, with whom he finished the season, and then played for the Mesa Desert Dogs. He was part of the AAA Sacramento River Cats in 2004, leading the minor league in walks.</p><p>Nick was called up for his major league debut with the Athletics, playing 20 games. He retained his rookie status the following year and landed 6th place in American League Rookie of the Year voting. Afterwards, Swisher started to show improvement in his offense, getting a .254 batting average including 35 home runs; his on-base percentage and slugging percentage also improved. In 2006, he helped Oakland get to the post-season and would advance to the ALCS against the Detroit Tigers, a series that they lost. In 2008, Nick was traded to the Chicago White Sox and soon became a fan favorite with his new team. Despite this, he struggled in his offense, and after the season he was traded to the New York Yankees.</p><p>Swisher became the starting first baseman of the Yankees for a while, but then moved to reserve first baseman and outfielder. Then he became the starting right fielder of the team, helping to get to the postseason and eventually the World Series, which they won in 2009 against the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. Afterwards, he trained to improve his hitting for the 2010 season, and became a part of the Home Run Derby. 2011 was also a good year for him, as he ranked 2nd among American League Right Fielders in terms of fielding percentage. In 2012, he declined a $13.3 million one year offer from the Yankees and was then signed by the Cleveland Indians with a four year $56 million contract, improving his net worth significantly.</p><p>In 2014, Nick had difficulties as he was plagued with injuries, and his percentages lowered as a result. He missed most of the 2014 and 2015 seasons because of injury, and was then traded to the Atlanta Braves and was released in March 2016. The following month, Nick agreed to return to the Yankees in a minor league contract but after he was not promoted back to the major leagues, he opted out of his contract to be with his family</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Nick married actress JoAnna Garcia in December 2010 and they have two daughters.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=12.725165562914><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3.8461538461538><td>1</td><td>Second daughter with <a href=#>JoAnna Garcia Swisher</a>, Sailor Stevie Swisher, was born June 28, 2016.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>In January 2013 signed a 4 year contract with the Cleveland Indians.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>3</td><td>January 3, 2008 traded to the Chicago White Sox then traded to the New York Yankees on November 13, 2008.</td></tr><tr readability=3.2881355932203><td>4</td><td>Father of the 1st child with a wife <a href=#>JoAnna Garcia Swisher</a> a daughter named Emerson Jay Swisher was born May 20, 2013.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>New York Yankees outfielder [2009].</td></tr><tr readability=9.2737430167598><td>6</td><td>His father, <a href=#>Steve Swisher</a>, played for the Chicago Cubs (1974-1977), St. Louis Cardinals (1978-1980), and San Diego Padres (1981-1982), and, like Nick, was a 1st-round draft pick.</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Men in Trees</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series performer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=12.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>American Ninja Warrior: Celebrity Edition</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Movie announced</td><td>Himself - Competitor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Chris Webber's Full Court Pranks</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Henry & Me</td><td>2014</td><td></td><td>Himself (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>MLB Whiparound</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Studio Analyst</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Mike & Mike</td><td>2012-2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Cleveland Indians First Baseman / Himself - New York Yankees Outfielder</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Trip Flip</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Yankees Outfielder</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Sunday Night Baseball</td><td>2004-2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - New York Yankees Right Fielder / Himself - Chicago White Sox First Baseman / Himself - Oakland Athletics Left Fielder / ...</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Rome Is Burning</td><td>2006-2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Correspondent / Himself - Alone with Rome / New York Yankees outfielder / ...</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Late Show with David Letterman</td><td>2009-2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - At Yankees Spring Training / Himself - At Spring Training / Himself - At the World Series</td></tr><tr><td>Better with You</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Rachael Ray</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>How I Met Your Mother</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Prime 9</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Game</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself, role</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2006 American League Championship Series</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Oakland Athletics First Baseman</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Quite Frankly with Stephen A.
