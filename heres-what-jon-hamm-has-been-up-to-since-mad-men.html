In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Today</a>, Hamm confessed that he didn't really have a "strategy" in place after Mad Men ended but that he knew that he "didn't want to play Don Draper again." With the colorful assortment of roles he's taken on after the hit show, it seems apparent that Don Draper is well in the rearview mirror.</p><h2 id=foray-into-film>Foray Into Film</h2><p>With his constant appearances on SNL,&nbsp;it's easy to see that Hamm has a knack for humor, but his film choices point toward his innate penchant for the dramatic. In Baby Driver, Hamm was gritty, smooth-talking thief, Buddy. The film was heavy on the action and fans were able to see a different side to the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast forward to political drama,&nbsp;The Report, in which&nbsp;he portrays Obama-era White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a>&nbsp;at a screening of the film, Hamm stated that he was both "appalled and transfixed" by the subject matter&nbsp;in the script and the masterful writing, which left him feeling like he had to take on the role.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Life Lessons We All Learned From "Mad Men"</a></span></p><h2 id=lending-his-voice>Lending His Voice</h2><p>Hamm has actually&nbsp;taken on voice over work for a couple of well-known properties. Firstly, he voiced Herb Overkill, husband of Scarlet Overkill, the villain in Minions,&nbsp;a role&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he says</a> allowed him to be "completely creative." He also had the opportunity to voice Boba Fett in the Star Wars anthology, From a Certain Point of View, a collection of stories that further the legends of the Star Wars universe.</p><p>The avid sports fan, Hamm has recently lent his voice to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a documentary</a> about the 2020 NHL (National Hockey League) All Star Weekend. Hamm is famously and ferociously supportive of his hometown of St. Louis' hockey team, the Blues and their baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If You Liked The Last Dance, Check Out These Sports Documentaries</a></span></p><h2 id=return-to-tv>Return To TV</h2><p>Arguably one of his funniest moments is Hamm's stint on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. At first, Hamm was only featured every so often as Reverend Wayne, Kimmy's captor, but as his character's popularity grew, he was given his own spinoff episode (Party Monster: Scratching the Surface) and will reprise his role in the upcoming Netflix interactive movie. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix press release</a>, the full length feature is going to be a doozy. "Three states! Explosions! A dancing hamburger! And you, the viewer, get to decide how the story goes."</p><p>Good Omens is another show that Hamm has graced with his divine presence recently. The Amazon exclusive is the adaptation of a book by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.&nbsp;Hamm, a longtime fan, said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a statement</a> about the show that, "I read Good Omens almost 20 years ago...Two months ago Neil sent me the scripts, and I knew I had to be in it." His character, the Archangel Gabriel, is pompous, well-dressed and mysterious, which&nbsp;seems like a part&nbsp;tailor-made for Hamm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Fans Don't Know About Jon Hamm's Private Life</a></span></p><h2 id=upcoming-projects>Upcoming Projects</h2><p>Hamm is proving he has a big year ahead as he co-starred in the highly anticipated sequel,&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick. Not much has been disclosed about the story or Hamm's character but it has been confirmed that Tom Cruise will reprise his role of Maverick, with Cruise himself calling the film "a love letter to aviation."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Tom Cruise Became The World's Most Popular Stuntman</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKOnnmK1ornMZp%2Baq12Xsqa6jK6nZqyfYsCqusKeZKaZlGK6prqO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-what-jon-hamm-has-been-up-to-since-mad-men.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20Jon%20Hamm%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Mad%20Men&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-what-jon-hamm-has-been-up-to-since-mad-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-jon-hamm-has-been-up-to-since-mad-men.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Jon%20Hamm%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Mad%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-what-jon-hamm-has-been-up-to-since-mad-men.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Jon%20Hamm%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Mad%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-jon-hamm-has-been-up-to-since-mad-men.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Jon%20Hamm%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Mad%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-what-jon-hamm-has-been-up-to-since-mad-men.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20Jon%20Hamm%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20Mad%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-net-carbs-are-in-cooked-zucchini.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many net carbs are in cooked zucchini?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-hasbulla-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hasbulla Siblings: Who Are Hasbulla Siblings?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
