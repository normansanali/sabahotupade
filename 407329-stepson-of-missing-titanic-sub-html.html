The businessman's stepson said his family wanted him to attend the event.</p><p class=fh>Hamish Harding, 58, was one of five people who went missing after going on a submarine to explore the wreck of the Titanic ship on June 18, 2023. While search and rescue efforts continue, his stepson revealed he'd gone out to enjoy a concert.</p><p class=fh>Brian Szasz, the British billionaire explorer's stepson, shared on social media how he hoped the businessman could be found safely. Harding was the chairman of Action Aviation, a private plane company.</p><p class=fh>On June 19, 2023, Szasz <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>sent</a> his "thoughts and prayers" for a good outcome in the mission to find his stepfather. Minutes after sharing his concern about <a class="Ed a" href=#>the billionaire</a>, the 37-year-old man shared a Facebook picture of himself smiling in front of the merchandise section at a Blink-182 concert.</p><p class=fh>In the post's caption, he <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>noted</a> how the post might seem "distasteful." However, he explained that his family would want him to attend the show. He shared how Blink-182 was his favorite band and <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>added</a>:</p><p class=fh>"Music helps me in difficult times!"</p><p class=fh>It's been reported that the billionaire and other people were 12,000 feet below the North Atlantic Ocean. The businessman and his companions might be in complete darkness, even as Szasz attended the music concert in California, nearly 3,000 miles away from where his stepfather was lost.</p><p class=fh>In another post, Harding's stepson <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2023/06/20/titanic-sub-passenger-hamish-hardings-stepson-attends-blink-182-concert-amid-search/>revealed</a> that his mother, Linda, asked him to delete "related posts" for privacy, thanked his followers for their support, and removed his earlier messages. On June 20, 2023, the audio engineer shared a follow-up post in his Instagram Stories addressing the negativity he was getting from attending the concert.</p><p class=fh>The San Diego-based man <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1377741/titanic-sub-missing-billionaire-passengers-stepson-defends-attending-blink-182-show-during-search>asked</a> if he was supposed to "sit at home," watching the news instead of going out. Szasz said he wasn't sorry but that Blink-182 had helped him through hard times since 1998.</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>Some hope came later in the day...</strong></h3><p class=fh>Before heading to the concert, he tweeted about his stepfather being lost at sea but revealed he was <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1377741/titanic-sub-missing-billionaire-passengers-stepson-defends-attending-blink-182-show-during-search>heading to the show</a> that night so the band could cheer him up and give him hope.</p><p><h2 class=jh><strong class=dh>How Hamish and Others Didn't Have Much Air Left?</strong></h2></p><p class=fh>On the same day that Szasz shared his Instagram Story post, authorities revealed that Harding and the rest might've had less than two days before they ran out of oxygen.</p><p class=fh>During a Boston press conference, US Coast Guard Captain Jamie Frederick admitted that their search efforts yielded nothing.
