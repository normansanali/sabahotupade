The match starts with Tasha offering a handshake that’s accepted. Lock up to start and they stay locked for a beat until they drop it at the same time. They move to the mat where they reverse brief holds. Deonna attempts a cover and then they separate again. Deonna applies a body scissors on the mat before Tasha twists the left ankle.&nbsp;</p><p>Back on their feet, Deonna sends Tasha to the apron for a moment but Tasha jumps back in with a head scissors takedown and then she twerks. Deonna takes Tasha down and then does some twerking of her own. Deonna counters a cutter by shoving Tasha off of her. They trade roll ups and then Steelz kicks Deonna, Deonna kicks Steelz, and they double clothesline each other down. Deonna traps Tasha in the fujiwara armbar but Steelz rolls out.&nbsp;</p><p>Steelz does another head scissor takedown and traps Deonna in Venus de Milo. Deonna slips out and applies the armbar again only for Steelz to roll her back into a cover while raking the eyes.

Steve finally rolls out while laughing maniacally.&nbsp;</p><p>Gia Miller speaks to Jonathan Gresham ahead of his world title match tonight.</p><p>Hendry cuts a promo before the bell and refers to Myers as “Adam’s b*tch.” Once the action starts, Myers is able to take control with attacking offense. He body slams Hendry and fires up in the corner. He goes for a spear but Hendry cuts him off with an uppercut before tossing him to the floor. Hendry gets Myers back inside for an uppercut, cover.

Hendry lands a pop up powerbomb, Myers kicks out. Myers goes to the ropes and thumbs Hendry in the eyes over the ref’s head. Myers hits Roster Cut for the win.</p><p>We see a vignette for Will Ospreay before he speaks to Gia backstage. Will is undefeated in IMPACT since returning and he’ll take on&nbsp;Alexander next week. Will touts himself as a former world champion while being the current IWGP UK Champion. He wants to see if Josh has what it takes.&nbsp;</p><p>Lock up, Eddie pivots to a headlock. EY lands a dropkick and continues to outmaneuver Eddie at each stop until Alisha grabs EY’s foot on the side. Eddie tosses EY with an overhead belly-to-belly. Eddie grounds EY with another headlock.

Sonny says she wanted to win the gauntlet in order to challenge Trinity. But now, it’s going to be Sonny all year long. Trinity walks up and hugs her. Trinity says she’ll talk to management about getting a match with Kiss next week.&nbsp;</p><p>Oleg throws the jobbers around while Dango joins commentary. Oleg tosses one of them with a fallaway slam. The other tags in but gets knocked out of the air. Dango runs back to the ring for the tag. Dango flattens one of the opponents and steps on him for the cover.</p><p>Jordynne cuts a promo on winning Call Your Shot when Bully attempts to offer a handshake. KiLynn King interrupts and says her win was pure luck. It should’ve been the King of the Knockouts. King and Bully exchange before Steve Maclin interrupts. He continues to call Bully soft.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rascalz introduce Myron&nbsp;Reed to IMPACT. Myron says they’re back together next week.&nbsp;</p><p>Next week: ABC vs. King & Jean, Rascalz in trios lucha action, Moose vs. Heath, Kiss vs. Trinity, KiLynn King & Maclin vs. Bully & Jordynne, Ospreay vs. Alexander.</p><p>Things start off quick as Shelley runs over Gresham with a shoulder tackle. Gresham ball taps Shelley while the ref is distracted, allowing him to use his wrist tape around Shelley’s throat. Gresham then low dropkicks the left knee. Gresham traps Shelley in a Figure Four until Shelley grabs the bottom rope. Gresham keeps picking Shelley apart and attempts a couple pinfalls. Shelley chops Gresham several times but then gets dropped on his injured knee.</p><p>Gresham drives Alex’s knee into the mat and then uses the wrist tape again to choke him while the ref can’t see it. Shelley regroups and traps Gresham in a straight jacket. Gresham gets free and goes back after the knee by slamming it against the mat repeatedly. Shelley manages a cutter into the ropes for some separation as Shelley goes to the outside. Gresham leaps out as Shelley jumps in, so Gresham pulls at the leg.
