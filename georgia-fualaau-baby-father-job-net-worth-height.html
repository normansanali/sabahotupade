After the news people are wondering who is her baby father? Besides the baby father details, we cover Georgia’s job, height, net worth, and more.</p><p>Tag along and read all that we know about Georgia.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Georgia Fualaau Baby Father?</strong></h3><p>The only information Georgia Fualaau shared about her baby father is he is a “delivery driver and aspiring boxer” who she desires to keep out of the spotlight. They have been dating for more than six years. He even lived with her at her late mom’s house from the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019.</p><p>Georgia says the couple has “definitely” considered marriage and “talked about it,” but she adds that there is “no ring yet.”</p><p>In 2020, Heavy posted that Georgia was dating one Josiah Santos. Going by the timeline of their relationship and what Georgia has shared with PEOPLE, Josiah Santos is the baby father of Georgia.</p><p>One LinkedIn of Josiah shared that he went to Mt. Rainier High School. He had previously worked for Damco in 2017. Then, he worked at Liberty Casework from 2017 to 2018. He was also employed at Mapsco.</p><p>Josiah is available on <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><p>Vili Fualaau had two daughters with convicted child rapist Mary Kay Letourneau Georgia Fualaau and Audrey Lokelani Fualaau. People recently reported that Vili’s daughter Georgia is going to be a mother, so Vili is a grandfather-to-be to a baby boy. In an exclusive conversation with PEOPLE, she confirms as well as discusses the status of her pregnancy and how her late mother would have felt about becoming a grandmother.</p><p>“I’ve known since I was about 4 weeks,” Georgia told the entertainment news outlet. “I’m very excited to become a mother. I have an amazing mother to prepare me for these years to come.”</p><p>Georgia claims that her late mother would “be really happy,” adding, “I think maybe at first it would be kind of shocking because I am her baby, but after that, she’d be the most excited grandmother-to-be.” Georgia thinks back on what Letourneau taught her about being a mother.</p><p>“My mom she was a very strict mother — but she also loved each and every one of her kids in their own way,” Georgia added. “So I feel like everything she’s taught us, just led to us being able to be amazing parents in the future.”</p><p>Georgia claims she has not suffered while acknowledging that being pregnant and a mother are “very new” experiences for her. “It’s been super easy, I have no morning sickness. I wouldn’t have even known I was pregnant until this time when I started showing. I’ve even been able to eat everything normally.”</p><p>Georgia says that she feels blessed to have a son although she had imagined welcoming a baby girl.</p><p>In November 2022, Georgia revealed that her dad&nbsp;<a href=#>welcomed baby No. 3</a> in a sweet Instagram post.&nbsp;“Hi Sophia, I’m your big sister! You’re so beautiful, I can’t wait to watch you grow. I’ll be right here by your side no matter what! I love you,” Georgia captioned a photo, according to&nbsp;<i>People</i>, who was first to report the news.</p><p>Less than one year later, Georgia announced that she was pregnant and expecting her first child with her boyfriend of six years. “It’s a BOY,” sister Audrey shared via Instagram alongside a series of photos from the gender reveal party in August 2023. “Words cannot explain how excited I am for my little sister to have this baby boy. You’re going to be such an amazing mom! Can’t wait to help raise the little cutie pie.”</p><h3><strong>Georgia Fualaau Job</strong></h3><p>According to Intouch Weekly, Georgia Fualaau has a job as a teacher at a childcare center in Las Vegas.
