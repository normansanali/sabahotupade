The actress, 59, who boasts a slew of accolades under her belt, including an Academy, a Golden Globe, and more, knows how to navigate the media scrutiny that comes with being an A-list star. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on July 26, 1964, in Arlington County, Virginia, Bullock shot to fame, starring alongside <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> in the 1994 blockbuster, <i>Speed</i>. By the decade's end, Bullock had already established herself as one of the most sought-after leading ladies, having excelled in a variety of genres, including comedy, romance, and action. The Oscar winner is a single mother of two. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Inside Sandra Bullock's Dating History! &nbsp;</h2><p>Bullock has carved the most stellar career as an actress and producer but the actress is still yet to decide on her life partner. After a dating career as long as her professional stint, Bullock is a single working mother. Throughout her journey to find the one, the<i> Blind Side</i> actress has experienced many great loves and heartbreaks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/30/348448625_629194985912728_8589380972474217204_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698691321649.jpg><p>Bullock's earliest-known relationship was with actor <strong>Tate Donovan</strong>, whom she dated for three years in the early 90s, and the two even got engaged before eventually calling it off in 1995. The<i> Miss Congeniality</i> actress famously courted actor <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong> for two years, from 1996 to 1998. &nbsp;</p><p>Following her split from McConaughey, with whom she shares an amicable bond to date, Bullock embarked on another two-year-long romance with musician <strong>Bob Schneider</strong> in 1999. Sandra kept her relationship with Bob as low-key as possible and later explained how too much spotlight tends to ruin good things. "It's something I learn through trial and error," said the Oscar winner. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/30/286410200_488790053044409_3245439442875468705_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698691328904.jpg><p>Sandra's other famous pairing was with actor<strong> Ryan Gosling,</strong> with whom she starred in the 2002 thriller, <i>Murder by Number</i>. The duo's romance was brief but it had a lasting impact on Gosling, who sweetly <a href=#>called </a>Bullock "one of the greatest girlfriends of all time." &nbsp;</p><p>The<i> Birdbox </i>actress has only been married once and Sandra's ardent fans would reckon that it wasn't a pleasant experience for the actress. Bullock and <strong>Jesse James</strong>, a television personality, best known as the founder of West Coast Choppers, started dating after the two met on the sets of James' show, <i>Monster Garage.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bullock's husband of five years, Jesse James, admitted to infidelity! &nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The duo walked down the aisle in July 2005- only to call it quits after several bumps and chaos in 2010. The couple's short-lived marriage started unraveling when James got accused of infidelity by multiple women, which led Bullock to pull the plug on their problematic relationship and file for divorce in 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah," said the television personality, adding, "I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's the end of the story." Sandra, despite being in the midst of adopting a son with James during the separation drama, went on with the process, and adopted her first kid, <strong>Louis</strong>, in 2010. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/30/337571385_538618605023694_2699698127268722006_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698691337359.jpg><p>Years went by before Sandra allowed herself to be in another serious relationship. The actress, instead, channeled her energy into quietly raising her son, and one more kid, daughter <strong>Laila,</strong> whom she adopted in 2015. The <i>Blind Side</i> actress shared that she adopted her daughter through the foster care system. &nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Sandra Bullock Dating? &nbsp;</h3><p>Bullock had to endure one more heartbreak earlier this year. The Oscar winner's longtime partner, photographer <strong>Bryan Randall</strong>, whom she began dating in 2015, and raised her kids with, passed away two months ago in August. Sandra's now-late beau was privately battling ALS for three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/30/338966915_3167527626879352_2486843398061891037_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698691344932.jpg><p>The <i>Birdbox </i>actress was a single mother of one when she hired Randall to capture her son's birthday party in 2015. As they started dating shortly after, the two became a committed team, keeping their romance away from the spotlight, and raising their kids in secrecy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong> on <i>Red Table Talk</i> in 2021, Bullock called Randall "the love of my life." "I found the love of my life. We share two beautiful children," Sandra said before correcting herself to add Bryan's daughter, <a href=#>Skylar,</a> to the equation as well. "Three children, his older daughter. It's the best thing ever," the actress said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/30/380873003_1190007028623789_5603763681962131330_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698691351121.jpg><p>Last year, the Oscar winner even announced her decision to step away from work to spend time with her family, which, in hindsight, was to make the most of her remaining time with Randall. "Right now, and I don't know how long that will be, I need to be in the place that makes me happiest," Sandra explained. &nbsp;</p><p>Randall's tragic death hit the headlines in August. A joint statement from the photographer's surviving family read, "It is with great sadness that we share that on Aug. 5, Bryan Randall passed away peacefully after a three-year battle with ALS." Bullock pretty much went MIA following the tragedy and only made her first public appearance days ago. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqyYp5yilnqjwculppyjo2K5sMLEZqOinpVisrm8y6ipnpw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsandra-bullocks-love-life-explored.html&text=Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Love%20Life%20Explored&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsandra-bullocks-love-life-explored.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsandra-bullocks-love-life-explored.html&title=Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Love%20Life%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsandra-bullocks-love-life-explored.html&title=Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Love%20Life%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsandra-bullocks-love-life-explored.html&title=Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Love%20Life%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsandra-bullocks-love-life-explored.html&description=Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Love%20Life%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./susan-sarandon-children-meet-eva-john-miles.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Susan Sarandon Children: Meet Eva, John, Miles">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sanditon-season-three-new-cast-members-where-youve-seen-them-before.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sanditon season three's new cast members and where you've seen them before">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
