His father was a businessman, investor, and philanthropist who died with him in the Titanic Submersible event.&nbsp;</p><h2>Was Suleman In A Relationship Or Single: Exploring His Romantic Life&nbsp;</h2><p>Suleman Dawood was a private person and didn't share anything about his relationship details. It is not known whether he had a romantic partner or girlfriend sharing a romantic affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/27/rubiks-cube-696x342%20(1)-1687859233938.jpg><p>While searching thoroughly on the Internet, nothing seems to be found on Suleman's past affairs too. He might be a low-key person sharing minimal on his personal life.&nbsp;</p><p>The celebrity kid Suleman might have focused on his studies rather than being in a relationship. He was enrolled at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland.</p><h2>Suleman's Parents: Shahzada Dawood And Christine Dawood</h2><p>Suleman was the son of the late Shazhada Dawood and <strong>Christine Dawood </strong>born on <i>June 18, 2004</i>. His parents were married for over two decades before Shahzada's unfortunate demise.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/27/Screenshot-2023-06-22-at-9.33.37-PM-1687859601015.jpg><p>Shahzada and Christine met while they were at Reutlingen University in Germany. However, there is not much known about their dating life and how they fell for each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Shahzada and Christine completed their marriage ceremony among family and close friends in 2001. Sadly, Christine had to say forced goodbye to him due to his untimely demise.&nbsp;</p><h2>Has Suleman Shared Any Siblings?</h2><p>Suleman Dawood wasn't the only kid of Shahzada and Christine instead has shared an older sister. His sister's name is <strong>Alina Dawood</strong>, a professional writer and blogger.&nbsp;</p><p>Alina is passionate to write about fashion, travel, and culture with other various topics. She is an aspiring freelance writer who also contributes to various magazines.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/27/344034782_191900813680317_1471480245607812929_n-1687860781698.jpg><p>Suleman's sister is an explorer who loves to travel to different parts of the world. She has traveled to different countries with her family and friends discovering traditions and history there.&nbsp;</p><p>Alina's involvement in philanthropic works can also be seen as she is involved with the Dawood Foundation. It aims to improve education, health care, and social welfare in Pakistan.&nbsp;</p><h2>Suleman's Net Worth Details: How Much Fortune Has He Made? &nbsp;</h2><p>Suleman Dawood was a student and didn't have an approximate net worth. So, he must be sharing the net worth of his parents and we will move forward to explain briefly about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Suleman's father Shahzada Dawood had an estimated net worth of <strong>$136.7 million</strong> before his demise. He has earned this massive wealth through his business and investing works.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Shahzada was in the position of vice-chairman at Engro Corporation, a Pakistani conglomerate.

She is the Executive Coach and CEO of Next Step Now Ltd and has a good professional background in her past.&nbsp;</p><h2>Learn About The Ocean Gate Titanic Submersible Incident</h2><p>The Ocean Gate <a href=#>Titanic Submersible</a> was operated to explore the Titanic wreckage site. Likewise, Suleman and his father with the other three people were aboard the craft but the Titanic submersible vanished on 18 June 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Ocean Gate Titanic Submersible was 22 feet long, 9.2 feet wide, and 8.3 feet tall. It had four electric thrusters, a battery of cameras, lights, and scanners to aid in deep-sea exploration piloted with a Logitech G F710 Wireless Gamepadvideo game controller.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/27/20c651c90654116f91ce304b1c568205-1687863300443.jpg><p>After the vanishing of the Ocean Gate Titanic Submersible, there were investigations made and found on June 23, 2023. Unfortunately, the submersible suffered a catastrophic implosion and all five crew members are believed to be dead.&nbsp;</p><p>The three people along with Suleman and Shahzada were Stockton Rush, Hamish Harding, and Paul-Henri Nargeolet. The bereaved friends and family members honor the memory of their departed loved ones by engaging in remembrance and mourning.</p><h3>Was There Anything Suleman Wanted To Do In Titanic Submersible?&nbsp;</h3><p>Suleman Dawood who died alongside his father and three others brought Rubik's cube on the journey. He wanted to set a Guinness world record in Titanic Submersible exploration.&nbsp;</p><p>Suleman applied to Guinness World Records ahead of the mission to see the Titanic wreckage. He was excited to try to solve the puzzle 3,700 meters below the ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>Suleman's father Shahzada even brought a camera along to document his record-breaking moment. However, it was never completed as he died on board the Titan submersible when it imploded during the Titanic Wreck exploration mission.&nbsp;</p><h2>Know In Brief About Suleman's Father&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#>Shahzada Dawood</a> was a successful British Pakistani businessman born on February 12, 1975.
