Since then, the rapper has been making a gradual climb in an upward trajectory in the world of rap.</p><p>What sets Bandmanrill apart from a majority of new rappers on the East Coast is that while he is a Drill rapper, he has been incorporating a lot of the elements of the subgenre “Jersey Club” into his music. Since he is from New Jersey, it makes sense why his output would be a fusion of the two major music movements of his upbringing.</p><p>Given the rapper’s popularity, many have begun asking questions about him.

The rapper was born on August 17, 2002.</p><p>The rapper is part of a new wave of East Coast Drill artists that have started gaining popularity in the 2020s. In fact, Bandman has been at the forefront of that explosion as he started making music right at the start of the trend back in November 2020.</p>@bandmanrill ♬ original sound – Ggggggffgggfdfh<p>As stated above, the rapper started gaining steam when he was recognized by Pitchfork for his music back in 2021. Since then, the young rapper has steadily been making a name for himself through his music and his presence online.</p><p>The three biggest platforms where he has a massive following are TikTok, where he has over 322.5K followers, and 6.9M likes, Instagram, where he has over 171K followers, and YouTube, where he has over 40.5K subscribers.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-is-bandmanrill-real-name><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-bandmanrill-real-name></span> What Is Bandmanrill Real Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bandmanrill real name is <strong>Siril Pettus</strong> and his rap moniker comes from his first name. The rill in his rap moniker is from Siril.</p><p>The name Siril comes from India, Telegu to be exact, and is a boy’s name which means God’s name, or the name of God. People who carry this name are stated to be stable, calm, and detail-oriented.</p><p>Siril is also similar to Cyril which is a Greek name that means lordly and/or masterful. The two meanings are very similar when set side by side each other.</p><p>As for Pettus, it has 7th-century Anglo-Saxon and Olde English origins and literally means a hole or an empty place. In essence, the rapper’s name means God’s name in an empty place, which is very poetic and fitting for the music he makes.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=bandmanrill-height-how-tall-is-the-rapper><span class=ez-toc-section id=bandmanrill-height-how-tall-is-the-rapper></span> Bandmanrill Height: How Tall Is The Rapper?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bandmanrill height looks to be<strong> 5 feet 9 inches</strong>. The rapper’s height is average among African American men.</p><p>As the rapper is still an up-and-comer, his height has not been recorded by many outlets. The biggest indicator of his height comes from his Instagram where he has posted a photo with fellow New York Drill rapper Sha Ek.</p><p>According to this Reddit post, Sha Ek is about 5 feet and 8 inches, and as Bandman stood a bit taller than him, one can assume that the rapper is 5 feet and 9 inches.</p><p>The rapper has a lean build and a very muscular physique, no doubt owing to his age and all the exercise that he does.</p><h2 id=where-is-bandmanrill-from><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-bandmanrill-from></span> Where Is Bandmanrill From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bandmanrill is from <strong>Newark,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>New Jersey</strong>.</p><p style=text-align:center>Due to Jersey’s proximity to New York, there are many Drill rappers there, but Bandman is one of the few who have incorporated Jersey Club into his music. Jersey Club is a style of electronic club music that originated in Newark.</p><p>The way Bandman mixes the two distinct styles of music that he was born and raised surrounded by is through rapping in a Drill style, i.e. violent and brazen lyrics, but over Jersey Club beats.</p><p>Bandman’s style, especially in the dissonance of the two genres, has produced some of the most forward-thinking music in Drill since Young Chop.</p><h2 id=bandmanrill-songs-albums-and-playlist><span class=ez-toc-section id=bandmanrill-songs-albums-and-playlist></span> Bandmanrill Songs, Albums, And Playlist&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;Spotify, Bandmanrill released his first single Fight Back on May 27, 2020.
