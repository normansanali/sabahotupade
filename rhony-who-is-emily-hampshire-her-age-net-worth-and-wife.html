As of now, she is 41 years old and it’s just a matter of a week when the actress will turn 42. Her interest in acting began at the age of eleven and as a high school student she appeared in various school plays.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>She was catapulted to popularity and recognition after she appeared in the 1998 romantic comedy, Boy Meets Girl, in which she plays Angelina. She was 17 at the time. Thereafter, she starred in a couple of well-known series such as The Rig, Twelve Monkeys, Chapelwaite, Ruby Gloom, and a few others which earned her positive reception from viewers, thus heightening her popularity.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>She was also the voice behind Diana Barry and Amy in the 2001 animated series – Anne of Green Gables: The Animated Series.

Speaking in detail about their friendship in the show, Lyons said, “We didn’t have a love connection.
