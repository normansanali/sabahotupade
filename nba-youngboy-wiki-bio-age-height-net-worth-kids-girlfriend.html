So you see he is actually a “YoungBoy”.</span></p><p><span>He is an American citizen but of African American heritage.&nbsp;His childhood was not really idle since his mother did not do much to raise him.&nbsp;Also, his father was barely in the photo – the man was behind bars serving a 55-year sentence.&nbsp;The law caught up with him when Youngboy was only 8 years old.&nbsp;Thus, the rapper was raised by his maternal grandmother until his death from heart failure.</span></p><p><span>It is said that this guy got his musical talent from his mother who was once a rapper.&nbsp;Youngboy started writing songs and singing when he was much younger.&nbsp;He left high school in the 9th grade to devote himself to music and soon began producing music at the age of 14.&nbsp;In 2014 he released his first mixtape “Life Before Fame”.&nbsp;“Mind of a Menace” mixtapes 1, 2, and 3 lag behind.&nbsp;The following year, NBA Youngboy had a falling out with fellow rapper Scotty Cain.&nbsp;In December of the same year, he decided to put his anger into words.&nbsp;He released a rap beef song which drew reaction from another song by his rival.&nbsp;As expected, this rap battle garnered so much attention and interestingly became the NBA’s first celebrity date.</span></p><p><span>His music career started to take shape, but then he got a run-in with the law in November 2016 and had to be jailed for a while.&nbsp;While that slowed him down, nothing could stop him.&nbsp;He released three more songs while there;&nbsp;“Win or lose”, “It doesn’t matter” and “Too much”.&nbsp;A week after his departure, he released another “Untouchable”.&nbsp;Youngboy dropped his debut album “Untill Death Call My Name” on April 27, 2018.</span></p><p><span>NBA Youngboy has had several nasty incidents with the law, he seems to have a thing for breaking the rules.&nbsp;Right after leaving school to pursue his career in music, he was arrested and sent to a juvenile detention center for theft.</span></p><p><span>You’d think he learned his lesson after this purchase, you’d be surprised.&nbsp;In November 2016, Youngboy was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted first degree murder.&nbsp;Apparently he was involved in a drive-by shooting.&nbsp;This time he received a 10-year suspended prison sentence and three years of active probation – that is, in August 2017. In February 2018, he was arrested again for assault, weapons violations and kidnappings.&nbsp;From what we’ve calculated, he was jailed but released on $75,000 bail in March 2018. The case is still pending around his neck.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>The NBA isn’t incredibly rich, but he boasts a net worth of over $1 million.&nbsp;He pulled off a lot in a short time through his songs and YouTube channels.&nbsp;At this rate, Youngboy will probably never be broke again.&nbsp;In fact, he once bragged about not wearing the same suit twice.&nbsp;It is said that he would throw them at fans while performing.&nbsp;Reportedly, the five-album deal signed in October 2016 with Atlantic was worth $2 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Children and girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>The rapper is currently dating Instagram star Jania Jackson.&nbsp;They started in December 2017. The two are no strangers to social media drama.&nbsp;There have been rumors that he cheats and is violent with Jania.&nbsp;His ex-girlfriends, Mallu Trevejo and Danielle Bregoli, reportedly fought publicly because of him.&nbsp;He even has four children.&nbsp;Kamiri, Kamron, Kayden and Taylin.&nbsp;All from different baby mothers.&nbsp;Despite everything that happened, they remained inseparable.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height – How tall is it?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As of this writing, the NBA is approximately 8 inches taller than 5 feet.&nbsp;Considering his age, it is very likely that this musician will grow up in the near future.</span></p><p><span>Here is.&nbsp;Everything you need to know about NBA YoungBoy, the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp;What can we say?&nbsp;He’s a hell of a guy.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGimkpZ6urvUp56bp6lixKq3yGaZoqddlrSmeceeoKCgpGK7psCMsKarrJhiuKqw0maeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnba-youngboy-wiki-bio-age-height-net-worth-kids-girlfriend.html&text=NBA%20Youngboy%20Facts%20%2f%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnba-youngboy-wiki-bio-age-height-net-worth-kids-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnba-youngboy-wiki-bio-age-height-net-worth-kids-girlfriend.html&title=NBA%20Youngboy%20Facts%20%2f%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnba-youngboy-wiki-bio-age-height-net-worth-kids-girlfriend.html&title=NBA%20Youngboy%20Facts%20%2f%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnba-youngboy-wiki-bio-age-height-net-worth-kids-girlfriend.html&title=NBA%20Youngboy%20Facts%20%2f%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnba-youngboy-wiki-bio-age-height-net-worth-kids-girlfriend.html&description=NBA%20Youngboy%20Facts%20%2f%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids%20%26amp%3b%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nichlmao-net-worth-313265.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nichlmao Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mel-gibson-sports-a-hefty-mustache-in-first-hot-seat-image.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mel Gibson sports a hefty mustache in first Hot Seat image">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
