On Feb. 20, 2022, the R&B icon shared that she's expecting her 11th child, which will be her second baby with husband Zackariah Darring.</p><p>She shared a photo of their beautiful blended family <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>, saying, "My husband Zackariah David Darring and I are proud to announce that our family will be adding a 'plus 1' to the Wyatt Bunch! Our other daughter, Kayla, wasn’t available for the picture, but you’re with us in spirit, Shuga!" Baby No. 11 follows the arrival of their infant son, Ke'Riah Darring, born on Jan. 6, 2020. Lucky for Ke'Riah, he's now a big brother!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>11 children is a lot to handle, but it seems like Keke and Zackariah have plenty of love to give. But what about her two other baby daddies? Let's take a closer look at these past relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Keke had her first four children with her former road manager, Rahmat Morton.</h2><p>She married Rahmat when she was just 18 years old, but their marriage was far from smooth. There was domestic abuse, and it actually got to the point where Keke stabbed Rahmat in self-defense. The two got divorced in 2009, but they currently share three children. Though Keke was pregnant with a fourth child toward the end of their marriage, she unfortunately suffered a stillbirth.</p><p>Rahmat, who grew up in Kentucky, has mostly kept out of the spotlight since then. However, aside from his relationship with Keke, he's also known for collaborating with R&B artist Avant.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She had four more children with her second husband, Michael Ford.</h2><p>After divorcing Rahmat, she moved on to TV personality Michael Ford. Both had entered the marriage with kids from previous relationships, so while Keke had three kids, Michael also had one child (Ke’Mar Von). Within the first five years of their marriage, they had three more children: Makayla, Wyatt, and Ke’Yoshi Bella.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>To the surprise of several fans, Michael filed for divorce in 2017. At the time, Keke was dealing with her son's cancer and was also eight months pregnant with their fourth biological child (Kendall Miguel). On social media, she shared a video accusing him of wanting to split due to his cheating, but his story was quite different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an interview, Michael <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a>, "I have loved, raised, supported, and cared for every child in our family, biological or not, including our son who is currently battling leukemia. I will continue to be that person and do all of these things, but I will not be her husband. I can no longer allow our children to live in a toxic environment, and because I love Keke, I can no longer accept toxic behavior."</p><p>After their very public, bitter divorce, Michael wasted no time in moving on. He began dating American Idol contestant Paris Bennett, who showed off their new relationship on social media. She got so much backlash that Michael made a public statement, asking that people be respectful.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "Keke and I are legally divorced. There was never any cheating that took place in our relationship by either party. We are now free to be whoever’s [man-crush Monday] or [woman-crush Wednesday], and they are free to use whatever caption they want on their individual pages. Us divorcees ... deserve to be happy and loved too, just like everyone else."</p><p>As of now, Michael and Paris are still together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Keke gave birth to her 10th child after marrying her third husband.</h2><p>She got married to Zackariah Darring in October 2018, and in the following year, Keke announced that she was pregnant with her tenth child. She gave birth to their son, Ke’Riah, in 2020.</p><p>It's unclear when they began their relationship, but Keke noted that she saw a huge difference between Zackariah and her ex, Michael.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "This man will never tell me, ‘I’m tired of dealing with you. You’re pregnant. I’m tired of dealing with this cancer. I can’t deal with you or your mouth [anymore],’ like I’m not supposed to have emotional problems knowing my baby is on his death bed — 14-year-old child, lying in the bed, dying, that I gave birth to.”</p><p>Thankfully, her son is now cancer free, and she has finally found her match.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>By the year 3000 everyone will be a descendants of Nick Canon or Keke Wyatt.</p>— DoctorJonPaul (They/Them/Tired)✊🏾🏳️‍🌈🎄 (@DoctorJonPaul) <a href=#>February 21, 2022</a></figure><p>Zackariah was actually Keke's first childhood boyfriend, having grown up with her in Indianapolis, Ind.
