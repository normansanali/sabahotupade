Her parents are well-known personalities in the American entertainment industry. Her father, Angelo Pagán, is a famous actor, singer, entrepreneur, and media personality.</p><p>In addition, her mother, Leah Remini, is a renowned actress. Since show business runs in the family, Sofia has been in the limelight since birth. Despite growing up in the spotlight, Sofia prefers to keep to herself and does not seem to want to be in the public eye as much as her famous parents.</p><p>Consequently, fans are curious about where the celebrity kid has been and what she has been up to. Here’s everything we know about Leah Remini’s daughter, Sofia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-24-43-fotor-2023090132615.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Leah_Reminis_Daughter></span>How Old Is Leah Remini’s Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia Bella Pagán is 19 and was born on June 16, 2004, in Los Angeles, California, United States. Her parents, Leah Remini and Angelo Pagán, had attained celebrity status by her birth. Hence, she was born into the limelight. Leah Remini’s daughter, Sofia, is of American nationality and mixed ethnicity. She has Australian Jewish and Italian ancestry on her mother’s side. However, she has Hispanic roots on her father’s side.</p><p>Despite being a celebrity kid, Sofia Bella Pagan grew up in a private setting and had a seemingly normal childhood. Consequently, most details about her early life and educational pursuits elude the public. However, in May 2022, Sofia’s mother took to Instagram to celebrate her daughter’s last day of high school.</p><p>In September of the same year, the famous actress announced on Instagram that she had taken her daughter to college for the first time. She added that although it was the proudest moment for her, it was also a painful moment leaving her daughter in the dorm. However, reports suggest Sofia enrolled in another institution in February 2023 after concluding the first wasn’t a good fit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Sofia_Bella_Pagans_Parents></span>Who Are Sofia Bella Pagán’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia’s parents are actors. Her mother, Leah Remini, is an accomplished, multi-award-winning American actress who started acting in 1988. She debuted in the TV series “Head of the Class.” However, she became a household name ten years later when she portrayed Carrie Heffernan on the CBS sitcom, “The King of Queens.”&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, she also appeared as Vanessa Celluci in “Kevin Can Wait.” Since her debut, the famous actress has starred in various films and TV shows. Aside from her movie and TV roles, Remini has co-hosted the podcast “Scientology: Fair Game” alongside Mike Rinder since July 2020.</p><p>Similarly, Sofia’s father, Angelo Pagán, is an actor who began acting in the ’80s and ’90s, earning a few minor roles in various TV series and movies. After meeting Remini, he began appearing alongside her in several of her projects, including “The King of Queens,” “Fired Up,” “Kevin Can Wait” and “In the Motherhood.” In addition, he made guest appearances on other popular shows, including “Martial Law,” “Dharma & Greg” and “Shameless.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-24-55-fotor-2023090133036.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Leah_Reminis_Daughter_Sofia_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Leah Remini’s Daughter, Sofia, Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia Bella Pagán hasn’t decided on a career path yet, as she is in college and focusing on her education. However, she debuted on TV in 2015 when she appeared in her mother’s reality TV series “Leah Remini: It’s All Relative.” Afterward, in 2016, she appeared in “JoJo Siwa’s Boomerang” music video. Consequently, many believe the celebrity kid might eventually follow in her parent’s footsteps as an actor.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Sofia_Bella_Pagan_Adopted></span>Is Sofia Bella Pagán Adopted?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, she is not. While there have been questions on whether or not Sofia is adopted, the truth is that her parents did not adopt her. Sofia Bella Pagán was born only a year after her parents married. The love story between her parents began in 1996 when the pair met for the first time in a Cuban restaurant and nightclub.</p><p>It was love at first song and dance for Leah Remini and <a href=#>Angelo Pagán</a>, who started dating shortly after. After several years together, Pagán proposed to Remini at an LA restaurant on Christmas Eve in 2002. The following year, the lovebirds tied the knot at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas on July 19, 2003.</p><p>Afterward, the couple announced their pregnancy, and the actress took her fans through her pregnancy journey as well as the birth of her daughter. After Sofia, her parents had no more kids and saw no reason to adopt more kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-24-49-fotor-2023090133224.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Sofia_Bella_Pagan_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Sofia Bella Pagán Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the celebrity kid is the only child her parents have together, she is not the only child of her father. Sofia Bella Pagán has three older siblings from her father’s previous relationships. First is Alexander “Alex” Pagán, born on December 29, 1986, from Angelo’s first marriage to Elaine Aviles.</p><p>Next is Nicholas “Nico” Pagán, also born to Angelo from his first marriage on December 10, 1988. Last but not least is Angelo Pagán Jr. He was born from his father’s second marriage to actress Raquel Williams.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sofia_Bella_Pagan_Movies></span>Sofia Bella Pagán Movies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia Bella Pagán has no movie credits, but she appeared in the “JoJo Siwa: Boomerang” music video and “Leah Remini: It’s All Relative,” reality TV series. Like Chuck Norris’ son, <a href=#>Dakota Alan Norris</a>, fans are eager to see Leah Remini’s daughter, Sofia, become a Hollywood star.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwLCyyJpkm52coa5uvMCgmKdlnZqytXnAnKurnaOoeq2xwKFkq52dnruqv4ydmK6fmKmys3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsofia-bella-pagan-meet-actress-leah-reminis-daughter.html&text=Sofia%20Bella%20Pagn%3a%20Meet%20Actress%20Leah%20Remini%27s%20Daughter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsofia-bella-pagan-meet-actress-leah-reminis-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsofia-bella-pagan-meet-actress-leah-reminis-daughter.html&title=Sofia%20Bella%20Pagn%3a%20Meet%20Actress%20Leah%20Remini%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsofia-bella-pagan-meet-actress-leah-reminis-daughter.html&title=Sofia%20Bella%20Pagn%3a%20Meet%20Actress%20Leah%20Remini%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsofia-bella-pagan-meet-actress-leah-reminis-daughter.html&title=Sofia%20Bella%20Pagn%3a%20Meet%20Actress%20Leah%20Remini%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsofia-bella-pagan-meet-actress-leah-reminis-daughter.html&description=Sofia%20Bella%20Pagn%3a%20Meet%20Actress%20Leah%20Remini%27s%20Daughter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-great-season-2-episode-4-recap-the-devils-lunch-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The GreatRecap: Diderot and Apricots">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./babyname.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
