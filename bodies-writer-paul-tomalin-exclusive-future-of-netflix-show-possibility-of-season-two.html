Putting a fresh spin on the detective drama is no easy feat, but Paul and the rest of the writing team have pulled it off masterfully.</p><p id=ewupuurBIY6 data-wc=43>&nbsp;A truly unique story, follows four different detectives, existing in four different time periods, who each encounter the same dead body. Connected by one, perplexing case, each detective hopes to crack it, but with endless twists and turns, nothing's as it seems.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Bodies – trailer</figure><p id=ecNyflZfuyb data-wc=39>Speaking exclusively to <strong></strong>, Paul – known for his work on No Offence, Torchwood and Shameless – revealed what it was like working on the popular show, and he also opened up about the possibility of a season two...</p><h2 dir=ltr>Signing on to Netflix's</h2><p id=edV7PfPv8cu data-wc=73>Based on Si Spencer's graphic novel of the same name, as soon as Paul encountered it, he knew it was something special. "When I sat down to read the graphic novel for the first time, <strong>I was just like, 'This is the wildest thing I've ever read</strong>,'" he explained. "<strong>It was like an acid trip</strong>. It was this totally bonkers thing that sprang from this wonderful 'Why didn't I think of that' premise.'"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0610a01ee21a-4timelines-bodies.jpg><p id=eWqDE9h0afl data-wc=89>Initially reluctant to take on such a "crazy" story, Paul eventually changed his tune. "I initially said 'Look, I can't do this. It's just too much of a lobotomy," he recalled, but after getting to work on the series, he quickly found his footing. Using the original graphic novel as a "road map", Paul and his fellow writers stuck wholesale to the characters, timelines, and general ideas, but they eventually realised that a piece of the puzzle was missing – and that's exactly where Stephen Graham's character came in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a786831d827a-bodies-mannix.jpg><p id=eP0IPp8D-LR data-wc=43>"I think as we got further on, we realised where the holes were that we needed," explained Paul. "And we quite quickly realised that we needed Stephen Graham's character to basically become an engine to keep things going in the direction we wanted.</p><p id=ecEFEP6PMwq data-wc=35>"He's a massive part of the story, obviously. And his character, he's not in the graphic novel, but what he embodies and his spirit thematically is wholesale to the novel. And that's what we did."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Watching Stephen Graham bring Elias Mannix to life</h2><p id=evWkmUojN5P data-wc=52>As for what it was like working with the man himself, Paul has nothing but high praise for Stephen Graham. "So Stephen, I must confess because it was all shot during Covid, I didn't have much contact with him at all, but it was just kind of like 'Stephen Graham's doing it.'"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aea04c5915fb-stephen-graham-in-bodies.jpg><p id=erUonpMG8Tr data-wc=49>"Having Stephen Graham on board meant for me..it was this major validation of what we were shooting for, what we were aiming for," added Paul.

But the premise that the show sets comes to an end.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1kfNyqIwmj7 data-wc=65>Paul added: "I think we've done it in a really satisfying way and I'm proud of that because as a writer, you actually don't often get to deal with endings, like true endings.
